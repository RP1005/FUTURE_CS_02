# SOC Analyst Internship Project (future_CS_02)

This project simulates the work of a Tier 1 SOC Analyst. It includes:

* Analyzing a sample log file (`SOC_Task2_Sample_Logs.txt`).
* Identifying and classifying critical security alerts.
* Building a SIEM dashboard in Splunk to visualize threats.
* A full Incident Response Report (see `Incident Response Report.pdf`) detailing the attack, impact, and remediation steps.
